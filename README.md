### Semester Project

Register and Login is already done, it is made using cookies with whole authentification and authorization and deployed.
So it is possible to register new account or login if its already registered.
Middleware is used so when clicked on inspiration page you need to be logged in first so make sure you login or register if you want to see that page.
Also there is profile page in right avatar icon and logout button. 
So useable pages are "/" "/about" "/register" "/login" "/profile" for now.
